## 📌 Task: Creating the README.md File

This document details the Git commands I used, the differences between a local Git workflow and a GitHub workflow, the challenges I encountered, my decision-making process for commits, and how AI assisted me throughout the process.

---

## 🧪 Git Commands I Used

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository from GitHub
git clone <repo_url>

# Stage changes for commit
git add <file_name>

# Commit staged changes with a message
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# Push committed changes to the remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git branch <branch_name>

# Switch to a specific branch
git checkout <branch_name>

# Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge <branch_name>
```

## 🔄 Differences Between Local Git Workflow and GitHub Workflow

### 🏠 My Local Git Workflow:

- I made changes locally on my computer.
- I staged changes using `git add`.
- I committed changes using `git commit`.
- Everything remained local until I pushed it to a remote repository using `git push`.

### ☁ My GitHub Workflow:

- I pushed my changes to GitHub using `git push`.
- I collaborated with others through pull requests and code reviews.
- I merged branches via the GitHub UI or `git merge`.
- I pulled updates from the remote repository using `git pull`.

---

## ⚠ Challenges I Encountered

- Understanding the difference between local and remote repositories.
- Resolving merge conflicts when working with multiple branches.
- Remembering the correct order of Git commands to avoid errors.
- Managing staged and unstaged changes efficiently.

---

## ✅ When I Decided to Make a Commit

- After adding a significant feature or fixing a bug.
- Before pulling changes from the remote repository (`git pull`).
- After resolving merge conflicts to maintain a stable state.
- Before switching branches (`git checkout`) to prevent losing progress.
